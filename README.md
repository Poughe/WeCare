<h1>Tech Stack Used:</h1>
  <ul>
      <li>HTML/CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Node</li>
      <li>Express</li>
      <li>Bootstrap 5</li>
      <li>MongoDB</li>
      <li>Mongoose</li>
      <li>Passport</li>
      <li>MapQuest API</li>
      <li>Mapbox</li>
  </ul>

<p>Growing up I never met people within my local community that excelled in a career that sparked my interest which could have resulted in me pursuing my passion at a much earlier age. It was a joy to work with API's and databases that allows me to collect and display what I want my users to see for a more streamlined experience.</p>

<h1>Optimizations</h1>
<p>Would like to fully transition my code from regular promises to sync/await and incorporate React as well</p>
<p>Upcoming Features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Utilize React for my front-end for a more streamlined user experience</li>
    <li>Add MeetUp API for users to find local events within their communities</li>
    <li>More community oriented API's</li>
    <li>Utilizing Twilio, despite limitations as a free user it can be very useful in communicating outside of the platform</li>
    <li>More to come...</li>
 </ul>
